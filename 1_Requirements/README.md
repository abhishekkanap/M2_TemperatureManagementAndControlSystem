# **Introduction:**

The temperature management system is basically used to control the temperature. The user gets access to turn on the heater. The temperature sensor keeps monitoring the temperature and sends the analog value to the microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the analog input of the temperature sensor and outputs a temperature value through serial communication. All the activities of the activities of the control system are done on a microcontroller called Atmega328. The functionality of the heat control system is coded in embedded c and the working is demonstrated using simuation in a software called SimulIDE.

## Features
- The System will sense is driver or passenger seated or not.
- Driver or Passenger has the access to modify the temperature in the vehicle.
- As per Drivers request, Heater will generate the heat accordingly.
- It is best for European Countries.
- Low cost and robust system.
- Modular Approach.

## SWOT Analysis
### Strengths
- User Friendly
- Easy to alter the temperature inside the vehicles.
- Modular Approach
- Low cost and Robust system.

### Weakness
- Its only applicable for those countries which are having low temperature.
### Opportunities
- It can be implemented by having both Heater and AC.
### Threats
- Not suitable for average or high temperature places.
